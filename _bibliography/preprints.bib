  abstract = {The increasing demands of sustainable energy, electronics, and biomedical applications call for next-generation functional materials with unprecedented properties. Of particular interest are emerging materials that display exceptional physical properties, making them promising candidates in energy-efficient microelectronic devices. As the conventional Edisonian approach becomes significantly outpaced by growing societal needs, emerging computational modeling and machine learning (ML) methods are employed for the rational design of materials. However, the complex physical mechanisms, cost of first-principles calculations, and the dispersity and scarcity of data pose challenges to both physics-based and data-driven materials modeling. Moreover, the combinatorial composition-structure design space is high-dimensional and often disjoint, making design optimization nontrivial. In this Account, we review a team effort toward establishing a framework that integrates data-driven and physics-based methods to address these challenges and accelerate materials design. We begin by presenting our integrated materials design framework and its three components in a general context. We then provide an example of applying this materials design framework to metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials, a specific type of emerging materials with practical importance in next-generation memory technologies. We identify multiple new materials which may display this property and propose pathways for their synthesis. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges in data-driven materials design, such as materials data quality issues and property-performance mismatch. We seek to raise awareness of these overlooked issues hindering materials design, thus stimulating efforts toward developing methods to mitigate the gaps.},

  abstract = {High-performance catalysts are crucial for sustainable energy conversion and human health. However, the discovery of catalysts faces challenges due to the absence of efficient approaches to navigating vast and high-dimensional structure and composition spaces. In this study, we propose a high-throughput computational catalyst screening approach integrating density functional theory (DFT) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). Within the BO framework, we propose an uncertainty-aware atomistic machine learning model, UPNet, which enables automated representation learning directly from high-dimensional catalyst structures and achieves principled uncertainty quantification. Utilizing a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework simultaneously considers multiple evaluation criteria. Using the proposed methods, we explore catalyst discovery for the CO2 reduction reaction. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy, facilitates interpretable feature extraction, and enables multicriteria design optimization, leading to significant reduction of computing power and time (10x reduction of required DFT calculations) in high-performance catalyst discovery.}

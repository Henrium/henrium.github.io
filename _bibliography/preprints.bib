  abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have excelled in predictive modeling for both crystals and molecules, owing to the expressiveness of graph representations. High-entropy alloys (HEAs), however, lack chemical long-range order, limiting the applicability of current graph representations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a representation of HEAs as a collection of local environment (LE) graphs. Based on this representation, we introduce the LESets machine learning model, an accurate, interpretable GNN for HEA property prediction. We demonstrate the accuracy of LESets in modeling the mechanical properties of quaternary HEAs. Through analyses and interpretation, we further extract insights into the modeling and design of HEAs. In a broader sense, LESets extends the potential applicability of GNNs to disordered materials with combinatorial complexity formed by diverse constituents and their flexible configurations.}

  abstract = {High-performance catalysts are crucial for sustainable energy conversion and human health. However, the discovery of catalysts faces challenges due to the absence of efficient approaches to navigating vast and high-dimensional structure and composition spaces. In this study, we propose a high-throughput computational catalyst screening approach integrating density functional theory (DFT) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). Within the BO framework, we propose an uncertainty-aware atomistic machine learning model, UPNet, which enables automated representation learning directly from high-dimensional catalyst structures and achieves principled uncertainty quantification. Utilizing a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework simultaneously considers multiple evaluation criteria. Using the proposed methods, we explore catalyst discovery for the CO2 reduction reaction. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy, facilitates interpretable feature extraction, and enables multicriteria design optimization, leading to significant reduction of computing power and time (10x reduction of required DFT calculations) in high-performance catalyst discovery.}

  abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have expedited materials discovery and design. One significant challenge faced in ML for materials is the expansive combinatorial space of potential materials formed by diverse constituents and their flexible configurations. This complexity is particularly evident in molecular mixtures, a frequently explored space for materials such as battery electrolytes. Owing to the complex structures of molecules and the sequence-independent nature of mixtures, conventional ML methods have difficulties in modeling such systems. Here we present MolSets, a specialized ML model for molecular mixtures. Representing individual molecules as graphs and their mixture as a set, MolSets leverages a graph neural network and the deep sets architecture to extract information at the molecule level and aggregate it at the mixture level, thus addressing local complexity while retaining global flexibility. We demonstrate the efficacy of MolSets in predicting the conductivity of lithium battery electrolytes and highlight its benefits in virtual screening of the combinatorial chemical space.}

  abstract = {High-performance catalysts are crucial for sustainable energy conversion and human health. However, the discovery of catalysts faces challenges due to the absence of efficient approaches to navigating vast and high-dimensional structure and composition spaces. In this study, we propose a high-throughput computational catalyst screening approach integrating density functional theory (DFT) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). Within the BO framework, we propose an uncertainty-aware atomistic machine learning model, UPNet, which enables automated representation learning directly from high-dimensional catalyst structures and achieves principled uncertainty quantification. Utilizing a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework simultaneously considers multiple evaluation criteria. Using the proposed methods, we explore catalyst discovery for the CO2 reduction reaction. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy, facilitates interpretable feature extraction, and enables multicriteria design optimization, leading to significant reduction of computing power and time (10x reduction of required DFT calculations) in high-performance catalyst discovery.}
